## CAn'T REProduce

This is my [RGSS3][1] (including [RGD][2]) playground.

### Get Started

Since I do not want to put any binary file in a git repo, you have to
put Game.exe, RGSS301.dll and [RGD.exe][3] (rename the DX9 _Game.exe_ to
_RGD.exe_, optional) in the root folder. Don't ask me where to find them.

### Build

There are several build tools on Windows, these are recommended:

- [TDM-GCC][4] for tiny experiments
- [MSYS2][5] for GCC toolchain build
- [Clang][6] for newer and more strict language mode
- [vcpkg][7] for libraries, prebuilt binaries
- [Visual Studio][11] if you are a fan of Microsoft
